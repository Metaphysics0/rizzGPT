# CLAUDE.md

For comprehensive project documentation, please refer to the README.md and additional docs within **docs/**

Key notes:

- We are using bun for everything, (so simply replace any uses of `npm`, `npx`) with `bun`, `bunx`, etc
- Our Icons are from Iconify, usually mingcute

```ts
<script>
  import Icon from "@iconify/svelte"
</script>

<Icon icon="mingcute:hand-heart-fill">

```
