## Design Patterns

- Using SvelteKit Server Sent Events for processing the conversation response.
- Protecting routes in the `hooks.server.ts`, basically checking if there is a user session, if not redirecting to `/sign-in`.
- UI design framework, simply pure tailwind. Added shadcn-svelte just for their tooltip + more components in the future.
- Using iconify icons & custom google font served locally
