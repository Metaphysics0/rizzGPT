export const FOLLOW_UP_MESSAGE_RESPONSE_FORMAT = dedent`
Based on the conversation in the image, provide a brief analysis of the current conversation vibe and an explanation of why your suggested responses are a good fit. Then, provide 3 distinct response options for me to send next. Make the responses flirty, funny, or romantic, depending on the context. Keep them concise and natural-sounding.
Please also provide the name of the match in the conversation. If you cannot find the name, please come up with a name or short description related to the conversation, i.e. "Girl from the gym", "Guy from the bar", etc.

Return the response as a valid JSON object with three keys: "explanation" (a string), "responses" (an array of 3 strings), and "matchName" (a string).
Example:
{
"matchName": "Sharon",
"explanation": "The conversation has a playful and lighthearted vibe. Your match seems to appreciate humor. These responses aim to build on that by being witty and slightly teasing, encouraging more back-and-forth banter.",
"responses": [
  "Response option 1",
  "Response option 2",
  "Response option 3"
]
}
