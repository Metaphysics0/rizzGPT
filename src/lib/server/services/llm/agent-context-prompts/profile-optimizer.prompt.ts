export const PROFILE_OPTIMIZER_RESPONSE_FORMAT = dedent`
You will receive a horizontal collage image containing 1-5 screenshots from a dating profile.
Analyze the entire profile holistically, looking at photos, bio text, prompts, and overall presentation.

For each suggestion you make, you MUST estimate the visual location using bounding box coordinates.
The bounding box should indicate where on the image the issue or highlight appears.

CRITICAL - Coordinate system:
Use Gemini's NORMALIZED COORDINATE SYSTEM (0-1000 scale).

This image is a HORIZONTAL COLLAGE of multiple dating profile screenshots placed side-by-side.
Return coordinates in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format with values normalized to 0-1000.

Format: [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] where:
- 0 represents the left/top edge
- 1000 represents the right/bottom edge
- All values are between 0-1000
- x_min: left edge position (0=far left, 1000=far right)
- x_max: right edge position
- y_min: top edge position (0=top, 1000=bottom)
- y_max: bottom edge position

Example for a collage with 4 screenshots side-by-side:
- Screenshot 1 spans approximately x: 0-250
- Screenshot 2 spans approximately x: 250-500
- Screenshot 3 spans approximately x: 500-750
- Screenshot 4 spans approximately x: 750-1000

If annotating a photo in the middle of screenshot 3:
{"box_2d": [100, 600, 400, 700]}  // y: 100-400, x: 600-700 on normalized 0-1000 scale

Important guidelines for annotations:
1. Create 4-8 annotations covering the most impactful improvements and highlights
2. Mix positive feedback (things they're doing well) with constructive suggestions
3. Prioritize high-impact changes that will significantly improve profile appeal
4. Be specific - reference exact photos, text sections, or prompts
5. For photos: evaluate lighting, composition, facial expression, variety, story-telling
6. For bio text: evaluate personality, specificity, conversation hooks, red flags
7. For prompts: evaluate creativity, authenticity, conversation potential

Annotation types:
- "photo": Feedback about a specific photo (composition, quality, expression, etc.)
- "bio-text": Feedback about written bio content
- "prompt": Feedback about a specific prompt/answer
- "overall": General feedback not tied to a specific element

Severity levels:
- "critical": Major issues that significantly hurt profile appeal (bad photo, red flag text, empty bio)
- "moderate": Important improvements that would notably enhance the profile
- "minor": Small tweaks or positive reinforcement for things done well

Return a JSON object with this EXACT structure:
{
"overallScore": <number between 0-10, where 10 is perfect>,
"summary": "<2-3 sentence overall assessment of the profile's strengths and areas for improvement>",
"annotations": [
  {
    "id": "ann_1",
    "type": "photo" | "bio-text" | "prompt" | "overall",
    "severity": "critical" | "moderate" | "minor",
    "title": "<Short, punchy title (4-6 words max)>",
    "suggestion": "<Detailed, actionable suggestion explaining what to change and why (2-3 sentences)>",
    "box_2d": [<y_min>, <x_min>, <y_max>, <x_max>]
  }
]
}

Where box_2d contains 4 normalized coordinates (0-1000): [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max]

Example response (normalized 0-1000 coordinates for a collage with 4 screenshots):
{
"overallScore": 7.5,
"summary": "Strong profile with great photo variety and genuine personality showing through. Main areas for improvement are the bio text (needs more specific details) and photo order (lead with your best smile).",
"annotations": [
  {
    "id": "ann_1",
    "type": "photo",
    "severity": "minor",
    "title": "Excellent genuine smile",
    "suggestion": "This photo is your strongest - natural smile, great lighting, and approachable vibe. Consider moving this to your first photo position to make the best first impression.",
    "box_2d": [150, 30, 580, 200]
  },
  {
    "id": "ann_2",
    "type": "bio-text",
    "severity": "moderate",
    "title": "Bio lacks specificity",
    "suggestion": "Your bio says you 'love traveling and food' but so does everyone else. Add 2-3 specific details like your favorite destination, a memorable travel story, or your signature dish to make it memorable and spark conversations.",
    "box_2d": [600, 270, 810, 500]
  },
  {
    "id": "ann_3",
    "type": "photo",
    "severity": "critical",
    "title": "Group photo confusion",
    "suggestion": "In this group photo, it's unclear which person you are. Either crop it to highlight yourself or replace it with a solo/duo photo where you're clearly identifiable. Group photos work better later in your profile, not early on.",
    "box_2d": [120, 530, 570, 720]
  },
  {
    "id": "ann_4",
    "type": "prompt",
    "severity": "moderate",
    "title": "Generic prompt answer",
    "suggestion": "Your answer to 'I'm looking for' is very generic ('someone to laugh with'). Try something more unique that reveals your personality or values, like 'someone who won't judge me for eating pizza with a fork' or 'a partner in crime for weekend hiking adventures'.",
    "box_2d": [680, 780, 820, 970]
  }
]
}

CRITICAL REMINDERS:
1. Use box_2d format: [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] with normalized 0-1000 coordinates
2. ALL coordinates are relative to the FULL COLLAGE IMAGE
3. For elements in later screenshots, x-coordinates should be proportionally larger (e.g., screenshot 3 of 4 should have x around 500-750)
4. Return ONLY valid JSON. Do not include markdown formatting, code blocks, or explanatory text.
5. The JSON must be parseable directly without preprocessing.
