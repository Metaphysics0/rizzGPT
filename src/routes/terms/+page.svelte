          As part of the Services, you may receive communications through the
          Services, including messages that RizzGPT sends you (for example, via
          email, SMS, or WhatsApp). When signing up for SMS or WhatsApp
          communications, you will receive a welcome message and instructions on
          how to stop receiving messages. For clarity, you may opt out of
          receiving SMS communications at any time by texting "STOP" to the
          short code, or you may opt out of WhatsApp messages by replying "STOP"
          to any WhatsApp message you receive from us. After you send the
          message "STOP" to us, we will send you a confirmation message and you
          will no longer receive SMS or WhatsApp messages from us. If you want
          to join again, simply sign up as you did the first time and we will
          start sending messages to you again. If you are experiencing issues
          with the messaging program, you can reply with the keyword HELP for
          more assistance, or you can get help directly by contacting
          support@rizzb0t.com.

          You may also opt out of receiving promotional emails by following the
          instructions in those emails or by contacting us at
          support@rizzb0t.com. If you opt out of promotional emails, we may
          still send you transactional or administrative emails, such as those
          about your account or ongoing business activities, including legal
          notices. With your consent, we may send promotional and other push
          notifications to your mobile device. You can turn off these
          notifications by adjusting the push notification settings on your
          device.
